# GDA
Google Data Analytics Project

# Overview
The Capstone Google Data Analytics Project was the final project at then end of the 6 motnh course. It took me through each of the
6 sections I completed previously and applied the learning all together. Given a company to work for I had to create models and gather insights from the data in order to help the company figure out why employees are leaving and who is leaving.

# Supporting the Business
The company supplied data that was taken from the company and needed suggestions based on the information gathered from the data set. Being able to accurately predict employees that are liekly to quit it will allow the company to change in order to stop this from happening.
