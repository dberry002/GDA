# GDA
Google Data Analytics Project

# Overview
The Capstone Google Data Analytics Project was the final project at then end of the 6 motnh course. It took me through each of the
6 sections I completed previously and applied the learning all together. Given a company to work for I had to create models and gather insights from the data in order to help the company figure out why employees are leaving and who is leaving.

# Supporting the Business
The company supplied data that was taken from the company and needed suggestions based on the information gathered from the data set. Being able to accurately predict employees that are liekly to quit it will allow the company to change in order to stop this from happening. 

# Key Models
1. This model goes along with the idea that in most cases the people that work on the most projects are likely to work the most amount of hours.Based on the tables it can be seen there are two groups of people that have left the company. One group that worked signifcantly less hour and one that worked a greater amount. The first group could have been fired or already decided to leave the company so they have less hours. The second group may have had employees that quit. This could be because of the long hours they worked and still being unsatisified with the company.
2. The optimal number of projects seems to be 3-4 as the least amount of people are leaving.

1. This could be seen as a very important plot for the reason of seeing which soecific department has the greatest number of employees leaving. Sales has the greatest number of employees leaving anf with this information it allows the company to dive deeper into figuring out exactly why the sales department is in this isutation. Then from there make decisions for the better of the company that will decrease these numbers.

# Conclusion
The main goal of this whole project was to figure out why employees are leaving and what employees are likely to leave next. Looking into the data we can see that employees are being overworked and because of this it is making them unsatified with the company.
1. Cap the number of possible projects
2. Tenured employees are seen being unsatisifid so look into incentives or promotion for these employees. There is no reason employees that have been working that many hours should and hjave been there for that long should see no benefits from this work.
3. More regular surveys could be beneficial in order to see how employees are doing thorughout the year instead of just doing on after a long period of time. This could allow the company to jump on the problems before they go to far.
